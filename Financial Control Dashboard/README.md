# Financial Control Dashboard

I have always controlled my expenses through Excel. I used to set up an interface and create a database to see the expenses and salaries on a monthly basis.

But then I thought, why not make it as dashboard in Power BI? I did and I was very happy with the result.

For everyone to understand, I followed a few premises:
1. I forecast at the beginning of each month how much I intend to spend per category without the investment amount;
2. I invest an amount and add this amount with the expenses, I consider the investment as an expense to make things easier;
3. I subtract the salary from total spendings and investments to find out how much I have left at the end of the month;
4. The expenses come out of 2 means, credit cards and checking account. I chose to show only the credit cards bills;
5. The screenshots bring: No monthly filter, filter for the month of April, filter by card invoice and filter by category.

The data has been artificially generated just for demonstration purposes

Tips for using the dashboard:
1. The whole page is filtered for 2021. If you want to see another year, just filter the page or add a small filter for year;
2. The forecasts should be added at the beginning of each month in the excel spreadsheet;
3. To add new spendings, salary or investments, use the excel spreadsheet;
4. Have fun!
