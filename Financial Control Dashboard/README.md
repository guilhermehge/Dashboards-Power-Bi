# Dashboards Power Bi

I have always controlled my expenses through Excel. I used to set up an interface and create a database to see the expenses and salaries on a monthly basis.

But then I thought, why not make it as dashboard in Power BI? I did and I was very happy with the result.

For everyone to understand, I followed a few premises:
1. I forecast at the beginning of each month how much I intend to spend per category without the investment amount;
2. I invest an amount and add this amount with the expenses, I consider the investment as an expense to make things easier;
3. I subtract the salary from total spendings and investments to find out how much I have left at the end of the month;
4. The expenses come out of 2 means, credit cards and checking account. I chose to show only the credit cards bills;
5. The screenshots bring: No monthly filter, filter for the month of April, filter by card invoice and filter by category.

The data has been artificially generated just for demonstration purposes
